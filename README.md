# stock-price-alpha-vantage-api
The objective of this project is to consolidate information about a stock (quantitative and qualitative) using Alpha Vantage API and scraping latest news about selected stock from Google. The aim is to allow users to make data-backed decisions before purchasing a stock. In this script, I have used $PYPL as an example.
The file is not complete. If you come across this and have any suggestions on how to make stock/financial information more accessible
